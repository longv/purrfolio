title: "Ludum Dare 53: Delivery Punch"
summary: "
Ludum Dare 53 with Delivery as a theme was the very first game jam that I joined.
There I had the chance to refresh on my game development skills and improve it further.
It took us almost a day to develop what we thought would an interesting concept.
We knew that we want to do a platformer so the team decided to have a delivery boy punching boxes to your door steps!
