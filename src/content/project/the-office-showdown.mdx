title: "Ludum Dare 55: The Office Showdown"
summary: "
I participated in Ludum Dare's game jam again to try out Godot.
This time the theme was about Summoning and I immediately came up with an idea of being summoned to endless meetings.
However, we should not surrender to these requests willingly. 
Finally, my partner suggested that the game can be played a PacMac style and we can actually fight back.
Hence we presents to you The Office Showdown!
