title: "Ludum Dare 55: The Office Showdown"
summary: "
I participated in Ludum Dare's game jam again to try out Godot.
This time the theme was about Summoning and I immediately came up with an idea of being summoned to endless meetings!
Then my partner suggested that we should be chased in a PacMac style with the ghosts now are the managers.
Hence we presents to you The Office Showdown!
